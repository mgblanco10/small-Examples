# Small-Examples

In this repository, a space is sought to be able to upload and save small tests of use of different libraries, technologies and development tools, both frontend and backend.
Small exercises are also carried out to iterate and put into practice the learning of different courses carried out and even technical tests.
Some of the folders have readme to document the work done, either by images or by some technical description.
